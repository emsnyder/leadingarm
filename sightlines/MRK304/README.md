## MRK304
**Found good fits for the following ions:**

C II 1334 using 2 components:
```
0 - MW
1 - Stream
```

Si III 1206 using 3 components:
```
0 - MW
1 - Stream
2 - Stream
Looks like there could be a component at -200km/s but can't get the contiunuum correct.
```

C IV 1548 using 2 components:
```
0 - MW
1 - Stream
Also looks like there could be another component around -200 km/s but can't get it to fit.
```
