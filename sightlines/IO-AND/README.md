## IO-AND
**Found good fits for the following ions:**

Si II 1193 using 4 components:
```
0 - MW
1 - And. (large error)
2 - And.
3 - Stream
```

Si III 1206 using 4 components:
```
0 - MW
1 - And.
2 - And.
3 - Stream
```

Si IV 1393 (G130M data only) using 6 components:
```
0 - MW
1 - And.
2 - And.
3 - And.
4 - And.
5 - Stream (large-ish error)
```


**Other Notes:**

Can't get a great fit for CII. Hard to distiguish between AND and STREAM components...
