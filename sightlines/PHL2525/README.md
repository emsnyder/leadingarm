## PHL2525
**Found good fits for the following ions:**

C II 1334 using 3 components:
``` 
0 - MW
1 - Stream 1 (large error)
2 - Stream 2
```

Si II 1260 using 4 components:
```
0 - MW
1 - Stream 1
2 - Stream 2
3 - Stream 3
```
Si III 1206 using 4 components:
```
0 - MW
1 - Stream 1
2 - Stream 2
3 - Stream 3
Looks like there should be a component at -160km/s but can't fit it.

Si IV 1393, 1402 using 4 components:
```
0 - MW
1 - Stream  1 (very large error)
2 - Stream  2 (very large error)
3 - Stream  3
```
C IV 1548, 1550 using 3 components:
```
0 - MW
1 - Stream  1 (large error)
2 - Stream  2
```

**Other Notes:**
Si II 1190 and 1193 were too noisy to fit well
