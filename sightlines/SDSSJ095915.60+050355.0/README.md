## SDSSJ0959...

**Found good fits for the following ions:**

Si III 1206 using 2 components:
```
0 - MW
1 - Leading Arm
Some smaller components there that VF cannot fit on.
```

C IV 1548, 1550 using 2 components:
```
0 - MW
1 - Leading Arm
Looks like two smaller components here but they are offset in velocity between 1548 and 1550.
```
