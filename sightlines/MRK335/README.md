## MRK335
**Found good fits for the following ions:**

C II 1334 using 3 components:
```
0 - MW
1 - Stream 1
2 - Stream 2
Looks like there are some smaller comps. that I can't fit.
```

Si III 1206 using 5 components:
```
0 - MW
1 - Stream 1
2 - Stream 2
3 - Stream 3

Continuum is a bit wonky but looks okay around comps.
