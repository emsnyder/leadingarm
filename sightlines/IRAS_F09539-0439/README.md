## IRAS_F09539...

**Found good fits for the following ions:**

O I 1302 using 2 components:
```
0 - MW
1 - Leading Arm
```
Si II 1190, 1193 using 2 components:
```
0 - MW
1 - Leading Arm
Had to limit the velocity fit range to be very small in order to fit the continuum correctly for each line.
```
Si IV 1393, 1402 using 3 components:
```
0 - MW
1 - Leading Arm 1
2 - Leading Arm 2 (very broad with large error)
```

**Other notes:**

Tried adding extra components for O I and Si II but didn't have much luck with VF. Single component fits were much better.
