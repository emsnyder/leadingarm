## IRAS_F09539...

**Found good fits for the following ions:**

O I 1302 using 4 components:
```
0 - MW
1 - Broad Component on Left Edge
2 - Leading Arm Component 1
3 - Leading Arm Component 2
```
Si II 1190, 1193 using 2 components:
```
0 - MW
1 - Leading Arm
Had to limit the velocity fit range to be very small in order to fit the continuum correctly for each line.

```
Si IV 1393, 1402 using 2 components:
```
0 - MW
1 - Leading Arm Component
```
