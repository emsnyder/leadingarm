## UVQSJ101629.20-315023.6

**Found good fits for the following ions:**

O I 1302 using 3 components:
```
0 - MW
1 - Leading Arm 1 (very slender with large error)
2 - Leading Arm 2 (very slender with large error)
```
Si II 1190, 1193, 1260 using 5 components:
```
0 - MW
1 - MW
2 - interloper?
3 - Leading Arm
4 - Leading Arm
```
Si III 1206 using 3 components:
```
0 - MW
1 - Leading Arm
2 - Leading Arm
There seem to be some other more slender components that cannot be fit by VF in this case.
