**Found good fits for the following ions:**

O I 1302 using 3 components:
```
0 - MW
1 - Leading Arm 1
2 - Leading Arm 2 
```
Si II 1190, 1193, 1260 using 5 components:
```
0 - MW?
1 - MW
2 - Leading Arm 1
3 - Leading Arm 2
4 - Leading Arm 3 (large error)
```
Si III 1206 using 4 components:
```
0 - MW
1 - Leading Arm 1 (large error)
2 - Leading Arm 2
There seem to be some other more slender components that cannot be fit by VF in this case.
```
