**Found good fits for the following ions:**

Si II 1190, 1193, 1260, 1526 using 2 components:
```
0 - MW
1 - Stream
```
Si III 1206 using 3 components:
```
0 - MW
1 - Stream 1
2 - Stream 2
```
Si IV 1402 using 4 components:
```
0 - MW
1 - Stream 1
2 - Stream 2 (wide but ok)
3 - Stream 3
```


**Other Notes:**
Can't get a good fit to CIV due to weird continuum levels.
