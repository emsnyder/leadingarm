**Found good fits for the following ions:**

Si II 1193 using 3 components:
```
0 - MW
1 - Stream 1
2 - Stream 2
Some smaller components there that I wasn't able to fit. Also tried 1190 and 1260 but didn't help.
```

Si III 1206 using 5 components:
```
0 - MW
1 - Stream 1
2 - Stream 2
3 - Stream 3 (very small with large error)
4 - Stream 4
```

C IV 1548, 1550 using 6 components:
```
0 - MW 1
1 - MW 2 (large error)
2 - Stream 1 (? Not sure if this is really a part of the stream)
3 - Stream 2
4 - Stream 3 (large component that's probably a blend of many smaller ones)
5 - Stream 4
```
