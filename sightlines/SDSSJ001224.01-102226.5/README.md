## SDSSJ0012...
**Found good fits for the following ions:**

C II 1334 using 3 components:
``` 
0 - MW
1 - Stream 1
2 - Stream 2
```

Si II 1190, 1193 using 3 components:
```
0 - MW
1 - Stream 1
2 - Stream 2

```
Si III 1206 using 3 components:
```
0 - MW
1 - Stream 1
2 - Stream 2
```
Si IV 1393, 1402 using 4 components:
```
0 - MW
1 - Stream 1 (very large error)
2 - Stream 2 (very large error)
3 - Stream 3
```
C IV 1548, 1550 using 4 components:
```
0 - MW
1 - Stream 1 (large error)
2 - Stream 2 (large error)
3 - Stream 3 (large error)
```

**Other Notes:**
Si II 1260 seemed to be blended so excluded from fit. C IV was very noise so fits are suspect.
