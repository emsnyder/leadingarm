## NGC7714
**Found good fits for the following ions:**

C II 1334 using 2 components:
``` 
0 - MW
1 - Stream 1
Looks like there could be multiple components but VF cannot fit them.
```


C IV 1548, using 2 components:
```
0 - MW
1 - Stream  1
Also had a strange contiuum fit but ended up working pretty well.
```

**Other Notes:**
Having trouble fitting SiII, SiIII because it has a weird continuum.
