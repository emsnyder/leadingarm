## NGC3125

**Found good fits for the following ions:**

O I 1302: using 3 components
```
0 - MW
1 - Leading Arm 1
2 - Leading Arm 2
Note that the errors on this fit are rather large.
```
Si II 1190, 1260: using 3 components
```
0 - MW
1 - Leading Arm 1
2 - Leading Arm 2
```

**Low confidence fits for the following ions:**

Si III 1206: using 3 components
```
0 - MW
1 - Leading Arm 1
2 - Leading Arm 2
```

Si IV 1393, 1402: using 2 components**
```
0 - MW
1 - Leading Arm
```

**Other Notes:**

Attempted a fit to SiIII (1206). Had to use a spline fit for the continuum. The VoigtFit code seems to not be able to plot well when a spline fit is used. Was able to fit three components but results are iffy.

Also attempted to fit to Si IV. Continuum around the lines is wonky and fit was hard to achieve due to low S/N.
