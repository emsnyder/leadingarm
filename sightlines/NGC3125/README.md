## NGC3125

Found good fits for the following ions:

**O I 1302: using 2 components**
```
0 - MW
1 - Leading Arm Component 1
2 - Leading Arm Component 2
Note that the errors on this fit are rather large.
```
**Si II 1190, 1260: using 2 components**
```
0 - MW
1 - Leading Arm Component 1
2 - Leading Arm Component 2
```
**Si IV 1393, 1402: using 2 components**
```
0 - MW
1 -
```

**Other Notes:**
 Also attempted a fit to SiIII (1206). Had to use a spline fit for the continuum. The VoigtFit code seems to not be able to plot well when a spline fit is used. Was able to fit three components with similar results as SiII.
